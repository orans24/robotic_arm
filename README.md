# robotic_arm
I create the code for my final project in the robotic course at TAU. in there I answer the five demands in this order:\n
1.Showing the task area of the robotic arm in 3d.
2.Showing random track in 3d for the robotic arm to the cube and pushing it.
3.Animate the moving of the robotic arm.
4.animate the moving of the robotic arm while considering the dynamic equation of Lagrange(gravity force)
5.Animate the moving of the robotic arm while considering the gravity and friction and compare the result to what we want to get.
